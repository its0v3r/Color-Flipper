This project is a basic color flipper that has two different versions: one for hardcoded CSS colors and the other for random hex colors. It was written only using HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript.

This project is heavily based on John Smilga's Color Flipper project on his HTML/CSS/JS course ([Codding Addict](https://www.youtube.com/c/codingaddict)
). But it might have a few or a lot of tweaks and new things added by me.

# Project Features

-   Fetch data from a local JSON (to simulate an API request);
-   Change the background color randomly using hardcoded CSS colors or random hex colors;
-   Check for the background brightness to set the button color to black or white (to be visible);
-   Copy the color text to the clipboard by clicking on the color text.
